## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### The OpenClaw UI says "Pairing Required" — what do I do?

Any new browser opening the OpenClaw UI needs a one-time device approval. Go to `/setup`, click **Manage Devices** → **Approve Latest Request**. That's it — the browser is now authorized.

### The UI shows "Gateway Disconnected" or an auth error

Go to `/setup` and click **Open OpenClaw UI** from there. This automatically injects the required auth tokens into the session. Opening the UI directly from the Railway URL without going through `/setup` first will cause this.

### How do I approve a Telegram or Discord channel?

After running setup:
1. Go to `/setup` → click **Approve Pairing**
2. Enter the pairing code shown in your channel

If no pairing code appeared, send `hey` to your bot in the channel — it will reply with the code. Then enter that code in the Approve Pairing dialog.

### How do I enable the TUI (terminal UI)?

Set the environment variable `ENABLE_TUI=true` in your Railway service variables, then redeploy. Once running, access it at `/tui` on your Railway URL.

### What is the difference between OpenClaw, Clawdbot, and Moltbot?

Same project, different names over time. Moltbot → Clawdbot → OpenClaw is the evolution. OpenClaw is the current name.

### How much does it cost to run OpenClaw on Railway?

**Railway**: ~$5-10/month (Hobby plan: $5/month base + usage). Free tier available with limits.

**AI API costs** (varies by usage):
- Anthropic Claude: ~$5-30/month for moderate personal use
- OpenAI GPT: ~$5-40/month depending on model
- Google Gemini: Often free for personal use

### Is my data private and secure on OpenClaw?

Yes. OpenClaw is self-hosted — all data stays on your Railway instance. API keys are stored encrypted in your volume. Traffic is HTTPS.

### Can I switch AI providers after setup?

Yes. Go to `/setup`, change the provider and API key in the config, and click **Run Setup** again.

### Can I use OpenClaw without Telegram/Discord?

Yes. The web UI at your Railway URL is fully functional on its own. Channels are optional.

### How do I access OpenClaw from my phone?

Visit your Railway URL in a mobile browser, or use the Telegram/Discord/Slack apps if you've set up those channels.

### Can I run multiple OpenClaw instances?

Yes — deploy the template multiple times on Railway. Each gets its own domain, volume, and config. Useful for separating personal and work use.

### Can I migrate off Railway?

Yes. Go to `/setup` → export a backup (`.zip`) → deploy OpenClaw on any platform (VPS, Docker, home server) → import the backup there.
